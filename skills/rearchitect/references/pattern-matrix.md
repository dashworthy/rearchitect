# Pattern matrix

For each of the 23 Gang-of-Four patterns, the **trigger** — the one situation in which that
pattern is the appropriate shape. Reach for a pattern only when its trigger genuinely describes the
problem in front of you; when none does, the shape is plain (see the SKILL's *plain-shape
default*). You already know what each pattern *is* — this matrix carries only the decision of
*when*, never an explanation of *what*.

Select **at most three**, and only where the trigger fires on its own. If one fires, present one.
If none fires, say so.

## Creational — how objects get made

| Pattern | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| Factory Method | The concrete class to instantiate isn't known until runtime, or subclasses should decide it — and the alternative is a call site hard-coding one specific concrete class it will later have to change. |
| Abstract Factory | You create *families* of related objects that must stay mutually consistent (a matched set), and callers must not accidentally mix members of different families. |
| Builder | Construction takes many optional or step-wise parameters, and a telescoping constructor or a long positional argument list would be unreadable or easy to hold wrong. |
| Prototype | Building a fresh instance is expensive or its concrete type is unknown, and copying an already-configured instance is cheaper or cleaner than reconstructing one. |
| Singleton | Exactly one instance must exist and duplicates would be *incorrect*, not merely wasteful. Rare, and often a smell — prefer passing one shared instance explicitly before reaching here. |

## Structural — how objects compose

| Pattern | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| Adapter | Two interfaces you don't control must interoperate, and you need to translate one into the shape the other expects without changing either side. |
| Bridge | An abstraction and its implementation each vary on their own axis, and a class-per-combination would explode combinatorially (M×N); separate the axes so each varies alone. |
| Composite | Callers should treat a single object and a tree of objects uniformly through one interface (a part–whole hierarchy). |
| Decorator | You must add responsibilities to individual objects at runtime, in combinations, without a subclass for every combination — keeping the wrapped object's interface intact. |
| Facade | A subsystem is complex but callers need only a narrow entry point; hide the orchestration behind one simple interface. (This is the "pull complexity down" deepening move wearing a pattern name.) |
| Flyweight | You hold a very large number of objects whose memory footprint actually bites, and most of their state is intrinsic/shared and can be pooled rather than duplicated. |
| Proxy | You need to control access to an object — lazy initialization, access checks, caching, a stand-in for a remote or heavy resource — behind the same interface it already presents. |

## Behavioral — how objects interact

| Pattern | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| Chain of Responsibility | A request should be handled by one of several handlers chosen at runtime, and the sender must not know which; handlers form a pipeline, each free to handle or pass on. |
| Command | You need to treat an operation as a first-class object — to queue it, log it, parameterize it, or make it undoable. |
| Iterator | Callers must traverse a collection's elements without the collection exposing its internal representation. |
| Mediator | A set of objects communicate in a tangled many-to-many web; route their interaction through one mediator so each knows only the mediator, cutting the coupling. |
| Memento | You must capture and later restore an object's internal state (undo, snapshots) without exposing that state through its public interface. |
| Observer | A change in one object must notify an open-ended set of dependents that the subject must not know the concrete types of. |
| State | An object's behavior changes with its internal state, and the alternative is sprawling conditionals switching on a state field; make each state its own object. |
| Strategy | Several interchangeable algorithms or policies exist for one job and the choice should be swappable, replacing a conditional that selects behavior with a pluggable one. |
| Template Method | Several variants share one algorithm skeleton but differ in specific steps; fix the skeleton in one place and let the variants fill only the steps that differ. |
| Visitor | You need to add new operations across a *stable* object structure without editing its classes each time; move the operation out into a visitor. |
| Interpreter | You have a small, well-defined grammar to evaluate and representing its sentences as an object tree earns its keep. Rare — reach for a real parser before this at any scale. |

## Patterns that solve similar problems — don't confuse them

The commonest selection mistake is picking a neighbor. Distinguish:

- **Strategy vs. State** — both replace conditionals with objects. Strategy: the *caller* picks the
  algorithm and it doesn't change underneath them. State: the *object* transitions between states,
  and behavior follows the current state. If a status/mode field drives a switch that recurs, it's
  State; if it's "which policy do I want to plug in", it's Strategy.
- **Decorator vs. Bridge** — both fight subclass explosion. Decorator: stack *responsibilities* at
  runtime, in any combination, on one object. Bridge: two independent *axes* of variation (M
  abstractions × N implementations) that should vary separately. "I keep adding wrappers" → Decorator;
  "every combination of two dimensions is its own class" → Bridge.
- **Adapter vs. Facade** — Adapter makes one *incompatible* interface fit another you don't control.
  Facade puts a *simple* front on a *complex* subsystem you do control. Adapter is about shape
  mismatch; Facade is about hiding orchestration.
- **Factory Method vs. Abstract Factory** — Factory Method makes *one* product whose concrete type
  varies. Abstract Factory makes a *family* of products that must match each other.
- **Proxy vs. Decorator** — same-interface wrapping, but Proxy *controls access* (lazy, remote,
  cache, auth) while Decorator *adds behavior*. Intent differs even when structure looks alike.
